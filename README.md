 2. Generic Methods <br/>
    - To Find all connected nodes of a given node.
    - Check if two nodes are connected or not.
 3. BFS - Breadth First Search <br/>
    - Check if there is path between two nodes and get the path.
 4. DFS - Deapth First Search <br/>
    - Check if there is path between two nodes, if yes print the path.
